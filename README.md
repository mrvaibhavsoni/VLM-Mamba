## Overview

VLM-Mamba is the first Vision-Language Model that utilizes State Space Models (SSMs) to bridge the gap between visual data and language understanding. This innovative approach leverages the Mamba architecture to enhance the performance of various vision-language tasks. By employing SSMs, VLM-Mamba provides a new perspective on how models can interpret and generate language based on visual inputs.

## Installation

To install VLM-Mamba, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrvaibhavsoni/VLM-Mamba.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd VLM-Mamba
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the model weights**:
   You can find the model weights in the [Releases section](https://github.com/mrvaibhavsoni/VLM-Mamba/releases). Download the necessary files and place them in the `weights/` directory.

---

## Usage

To use VLM-Mamba, follow these steps:

1. **Load the model**:
   ```python
   from vlm_mamba import VLMModel

   model = VLMModel.load_from_pretrained('path/to/weights')
   ```

2. **Prepare your data**:
   Ensure your input data is formatted correctly. For images, use standard formats like JPEG or PNG. For text, plain text files work best.

3. **Run inference**:
   ```python
   results = model.predict(image_path='path/to/image.jpg', text='Your query here')
   print(results)
   ```

## Model Architecture

VLM-Mamba employs a unique architecture based on State Space Models. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts both visual and textual data.
- **SSM Layer**: Processes inputs using state space dynamics to capture dependencies.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant parts of the input data for improved understanding.
- **Output Layer**: Generates predictions in a coherent format.

## Training

Training VLM-Mamba involves the following steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure you have a dataset with paired images and text.
2. **Configure training parameters**: Modify `config.yaml` to set your training parameters, such as batch size and learning rate.
3. **Start training**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

Monitor the training process through the console logs. Adjust parameters as necessary for optimal performance.
